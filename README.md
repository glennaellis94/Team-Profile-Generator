# Team-Profile-Generator

Developed a team generator utilizing node js. I used jest for testing and inquirer for recieving user prompts.

The purpose of this application is to create an HTML page with inputs for a working team with a Manager, Engineer and Intern.

All tests pass, the code does not output an HTML file. I ran out of time refractoring the code from module 9 but i successfully save all user inputs into an object.
